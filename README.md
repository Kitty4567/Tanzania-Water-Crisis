# Tanzania-Water-Crisis: Addressed the water and sanitation crisis in Tanzania, affecting 59 million people, with a focus on improving access to clean drinking water.

▪	Utilized machine learning models to predict the functionality of groundwater pumps across the country, aiming to enhance the efficiency of maintenance and repair operations.

▪	Analyzed data on water pump functionality, incorporating variables such as location, usage, and maintenance history.

▪	Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights and understand underlying patterns and relationships between various variables.

▪	Implemented machine learning models including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to classify the operational status of water pumps.

▪	Conducted data preprocessing and feature engineering to optimize model accuracy and performance.

▪	Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, ROC score, and F1 score, ensuring reliable predictions.

▪	Visualized data insights and model results using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to support decision-making processes.
